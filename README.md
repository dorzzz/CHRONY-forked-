# CS FINAL PROJECT

## idea:
As college students we are always in a need to plan our time to best of our abilitys . trying to fit our work , studys , friends and everything else . we wanted to create a combination of planning apps (calenders , todo lists , etc..)
and time tracker apps ( pomodoro , forest , etc...) . 
So chrony was the child of that purpose , to being able to track our time and to have a calender like UI to have us focus on the things that are important to us that we have or want to do over the day, week , etc...
